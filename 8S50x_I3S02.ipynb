So, selecting the 3rd through 4th row and 5th through 7th column of an array would be denoted `A[2:4,4:7]`. Leaving the end of the range blank, for example `1:`, denotes that the range ends at the last row or column in the matrix. Similarly, you can leave the first index blank to indicate a range that starts at the first row or column.
