He found that the linearized weak-field equations had wave solutions. By analogy to electromagnetism, time variation of the mass quadrupole moment of the source is expected to lead to transverse waves of spatial strain. The existence of GW was first demonstrated in 1974 by the discovery of a binary system composed of a pulsar in orbit around a neutron star by Hulse and Taylor <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...195L..51H/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>. However, direct detections of GW did not arrive until 2016. In that year, The LIGO (The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) collaboration reported the first direct detection of GW from a binary black hole system merging to form a single black hole <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>.

After getting familiar with the basic analysis methods, you need to explore more events, check the consistence between detectors, match numerical relativity waveform template to extract accurate information of the source, compare with LIGO published results, and develop a machinery to search GW event within a long time range."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "83ea2240", "metadata": {"id": "83ea2240", "tags": ["learner", "md"]}, "source": ["<h3>Setting the correct matplotlib version</h3>\n", "\n", "First, let's install the correct version of matplotlib for our packages. \n", "\n", "**If you are using Google Colab**: This install will require you to restart the runtime because colab has a different version of matplotlib installed.
